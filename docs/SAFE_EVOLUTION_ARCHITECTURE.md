# Safe Evolution Architecture
## Never Modify Live Code - Evolve the Blueprint

## Core Principle

**The agent NEVER modifies its own live, running code.**

Instead, it operates on a **"digital twin"** or **"blueprint"** of its codebase mirrored in Neo4j. This creates a robust, sandboxed environment where changes can be tested and validated before being proposed for integration.

---

## The Golden Rule

```
❌ NEVER: Agent modifies live .go files
✅ ALWAYS: Agent modifies mirrored code in Neo4j
✅ THEN: Human approves → Integration process → Live update
```

---

## Architecture Components

### 1. The Mirrored Codebase (Neo4j)

The agent's entire codebase is parsed and stored as a structured graph in Neo4j via **LightRAG**.

**Graph Schema**:
```cypher
// File node
(:File {
  uuid: "file-abc-123",
  name: "agent_controller.go",
  path: "/backend/internal/",
  language: "go",
  status: "active",
  version: 1
})

// Function node
(:Function {
  uuid: "func-def-456",
  name: "HandleTask",
  source_code: "func (a *AgentController) HandleTask(...) { ... }",
  language: "go",
  status: "active",
  version: 1,
  mutable: false  // Go code is IMMUTABLE
})

// Python skill node
(:Function {
  uuid: "skill-ghi-789",
  name: "analyze_data.py",
  source_code: "def analyze_data(data): ...",
  language: "python",
  status: "active",
  version: 1,
  mutable: true  // Python skills are EVOLVABLE
})
```

**Relationships**:
```cypher
(File)-[:CONTAINS]->(Function)
(Function)-[:CALLS]->(Function)
(Function)-[:DEPENDS_ON]->(Package)
(Function_v2)-[:EVOLVED_FROM]->(Function_v1)
```

---

### 2. The Polyglot Safety Barrier

**CRITICAL**: Only Python skills can be evolved, NOT Go core!

#### Immutable Core (Go)

**Cannot be modified by agent**:
- Main PRAR loop
- Fiber v3 web server
- LightRAG integration
- Watchdog process
- Core orchestration

**Tagged in Neo4j**:
```cypher
(:Function {
  language: "go",
  mutable: false  // IMMUTABLE!
})
```

#### Evolvable Skills (Python)

**Can be modified by agent**:
- Data analysis scripts
- Complex reasoning strategies
- Tool implementations
- Format transformers

**Tagged in Neo4j**:
```cypher
(:Function {
  language: "python",
  mutable: true  // EVOLVABLE!
})
```

---

### 3. The Safe Evolution Sandbox

When the agent identifies code for improvement, it operates **ONLY** on the Neo4j mirror.

**Evolution Process**:

```
1. TARGET SELECTION
   Agent queries Neo4j:
   MATCH (f:Function {mutable: true})
   WHERE f.complexity > 10
   RETURN f
   ↓
   Finds: analyze_data.py (Python skill)

2. CODE RETRIEVAL
   Read source_code from Neo4j node
   ↓
   Original code retrieved from mirror

3. LLM-BASED MUTATION
   OpenEvolve generates variations
   ↓
   Creates 100+ variations

4. SANDBOX EVALUATION
   Each variation tested in isolated container
   ↓
   Fitness function evaluates performance

5. GRAPH UPDATE
   Best code stored as NEW node in Neo4j
   ↓
   (:Function {
     uuid: "skill-ghi-789-v2",
     source_code: "improved code",
     status: "validated",  // NOT active yet!
     version: 2
   })
   ↓
   Create relationship:
   (skill-ghi-789-v2)-[:EVOLVED_FROM]->(skill-ghi-789)
```

**Key Point**: Live file system is NEVER touched during evolution!

---

### 4. The Watchdog on LightRAG

The Watchdog is a separate, continuously running process that monitors the LightRAG stream.

**Role**: Concept development and pattern recognition

**How It Works**:

```
1. MONITOR STREAM
   Watchdog taps into LightRAG data pipeline
   ↓
   Observes: perceptions, reasoning, actions, outcomes

2. PATTERN RECOGNITION
   Statistical analysis + LLM reasoning
   ↓
   Detects:
   - Failure clusters (repeated errors)
   - Success sequences (winning patterns)
   - Novel correlations (unexpected relationships)

3. CONCEPT FORMATION
   Creates high-level abstractions
   ↓
   Example: Multiple file-not-found errors handled by checking existence
   ↓
   Creates concept: "Defensive File Handling"
   ↓
   Stores in Neo4j:
   (:Concept {
     uuid: "concept-jkl-012",
     name: "Defensive File Handling",
     description: "Check file existence before operations",
     successRate: 0.95,
     instances: 47
   })

4. GRAPH ENRICHMENT
   Links concept to raw data
   ↓
   (Action)-[:IMPLEMENTS_CONCEPT]->(Concept)
   (Outcome)-[:VALIDATES_CONCEPT]->(Concept)
```

**Benefit**: Turns raw logs into structured knowledge!

---

### 5. The Approval and Integration Workflow

Evolved code does NOT automatically become active. It requires approval.

**Process**:

```
1. PROPOSAL GENERATION
   Agent creates change proposal:
   {
     "target": "analyze_data.py",
     "originalCode": "...",
     "evolvedCode": "...",
     "fitnessImprovement": "40% faster, 25% more accurate",
     "reasoning": "Optimized algorithm based on pattern X",
     "validationResults": {
       "tests_passed": 47,
       "tests_failed": 0,
       "performance_gain": 0.40
     }
   }

2. HUMAN-IN-THE-LOOP REVIEW (Recommended)
   Proposal presented in Agentic IDE
   ↓
   Human reviews:
   - Code diff
   - Fitness metrics
   - Validation results
   - Reasoning
   ↓
   Decision: APPROVE or REJECT

3. AUTOMATED INTEGRATION (If approved)
   a. Backup live file:
      cp analyze_data.py analyze_data.py.backup
   
   b. Read evolved code from Neo4j:
      MATCH (f:Function {uuid: "skill-ghi-789-v2"})
      RETURN f.source_code
   
   c. Write to live file:
      echo "$evolved_code" > analyze_data.py
   
   d. Update Neo4j mirror:
      MATCH (f:Function {uuid: "skill-ghi-789-v2"})
      SET f.status = 'active'
   
   e. Restart/hot-swap:
      - Graceful restart (if needed)
      - Or hot-swap module (if supported)
```

---

## The Complete Safe Evolution Loop

```
1. LIVE OPERATION
   Agent runs, performing tasks
   ↓
   All actions streamed to LightRAG

2. CONCEPTUALIZATION
   Watchdog observes LightRAG stream
   ↓
   Identifies patterns
   ↓
   Creates Concept nodes in Neo4j

3. SELF-REFLECTION
   Agent queries enriched Neo4j graph
   ↓
   Reasons about own performance using concepts

4. TARGETED EVOLUTION
   Agent identifies Python skill for improvement
   ↓
   Queries mirrored codebase in Neo4j:
   MATCH (f:Function {mutable: true, complexity: > 10})
   RETURN f

5. SANDBOXED IMPROVEMENT
   OpenEvolve evolves code in Neo4j mirror
   ↓
   Creates new, validated, INACTIVE version
   ↓
   (Function_v2)-[:EVOLVED_FROM]->(Function_v1)

6. PROPOSAL & APPROVAL
   Change proposal generated
   ↓
   Human reviews and approves
   ↓
   Automated integration to live system

7. CYCLE REPEATS
   Updated agent runs with improved capabilities
   ↓
   Entire cycle begins again
```

## Safety Guarantees

### 1. Live Code Protection

```
✅ Go core is NEVER modified (immutable)
✅ Only Python skills can evolve (mutable)
✅ Evolution happens in Neo4j mirror (sandbox)
✅ Live files never touched during evolution
✅ Human approval required for integration
```

### 2. Rollback Capability

```
// Every version is preserved
(Function_v3)-[:EVOLVED_FROM]->(Function_v2)-[:EVOLVED_FROM]->(Function_v1)

// Rollback to any version
MATCH (f:Function {name: "analyze_data.py", version: 1})
RETURN f.source_code
```

### 3. Audit Trail

```
// Complete history in Neo4j
MATCH path = (latest:Function)-[:EVOLVED_FROM*]->(original)
WHERE latest.name = "analyze_data.py"
RETURN path

// Shows:
- All versions
- Fitness improvements
- Approval timestamps
- Reasoning for changes
```

### 4. Concept-Driven Evolution

```
// Agent doesn't evolve blindly
// It evolves based on learned concepts

MATCH (f:Function)-[:IMPLEMENTS_CONCEPT]->(c:Concept)
WHERE c.successRate > 0.9
RETURN f, c

// Only applies proven patterns!
```

---

## Integration with Existing Architecture

### LightRAG Integration

```go
// Parse codebase
functions := parseGoAST(filePath)

// Insert into LightRAG (which stores in Neo4j)
for _, fn := range functions {
    uuid, _ := lightRAG.InsertPerception(
        ctx,
        generateUUID(),
        fmt.Sprintf("Function: %s\n%s", fn.Name, fn.Content),
        map[string]interface{}{
            "type":     "function",
            "language": fn.Language,  // "go" or "python"
            "mutable":  fn.Language == "python",  // Only Python is mutable!
            "version":  1,
            "status":   "active",
        },
    )
}
```

### OpenEvolve Integration

```python
# In OpenEvolve MCP server

def evolve_code(code, language):
    # Safety check
    if language == "go":
        raise ValueError("Cannot evolve Go core code!")
    
    if language != "python":
        raise ValueError("Only Python skills can evolve!")
    
    # Proceed with evolution (in Neo4j mirror only)
    evolved_code = run_evolution(code)
    
    # Store in Neo4j as new version (inactive)
    uuid = lightrag.insert_action(
        id=generate_uuid(),
        plan=f"Evolve {code.name}",
        result=evolved_code,
        reasoning_uuid=reasoning_id
    )
    
    # Mark as validated but NOT active
    neo4j.execute("""
        MATCH (f:Function {uuid: $uuid})
        SET f.status = 'validated',
            f.version = $version
    """, uuid=uuid, version=old_version + 1)
    
    return {
        "uuid": uuid,
        "status": "validated",
        "requires_approval": True
    }
```

### Dynamic Thinking Integration

```python
# In perceive tool

def perceive(task):
    # Agent can perceive its own code
    result = lightrag.query("inefficient Python skills")
    
    # But can ONLY target Python skills
    cypher = """
        MATCH (f:Function {mutable: true})
        WHERE f.complexity > 10
        RETURN f
    """
    
    # Returns only Python skills, never Go core!
```
